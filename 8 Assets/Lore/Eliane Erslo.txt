My child,
Humanity has ventured forth into the night sky, asserting domanace over all that belongs to us.
But the very stars took back what is rightfully ours.
I created you to PURGE these beings from our derelicts.
They hide behind our eyes, in our very walls.
But you my beautiful child, can see them for what they are.
NOCEO ABSONCDITUM Eradictor
Bathe in their blood, drink it in.
Become THEIR nightmare, For All Mankind.

-Dr. Eliane "Mother" Erslo
