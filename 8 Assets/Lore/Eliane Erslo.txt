My child,
Humanity has ventured forth into the night sky, asserting domanace over all that belongs to us.
But the very stars took back what is rightfully ours.
I created you to PURGE these beings from our derelicts.
They hide behind our eyes, in our very walls.
But you my beautiful child, can see them for what they are.

Bathe in blood, adorn yourself with entrails.

Ut inanis timeat te, for the Dagon, for Humanity.
